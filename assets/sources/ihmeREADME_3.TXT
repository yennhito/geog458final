United States - King County, Washington Life Expectancy and Cause-Specific Mortality by Census Tract 1990-2014

IHME research produced estimates for life expectancy and cause-specific mortality at the census tract level for King County, Washington for 1990-2014. The estimates were generated using death registration data from the Washington State Department of Health Center for Health Statistics; population counts by age group, sex, and census tract from the Washington State Office of Financial Management (OFM); the cause list developed for the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2015; and the application of small area estimation models. This dataset provides estimates for life expectancy at birth, mortality rates, and years of life lost (YLL) rates for 152 causes of death by age and sex for 397 census tracts. Results of the study were published in The Lancet Public Health in September 2017 in "Variation in life expectancy and mortality by cause among neighbourhoods in King County, WA, USA, 1990–2014: a census tract-level analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015."
