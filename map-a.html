               Healthcare Locations and Health Expectancy
               </h1>
               <hr>

               <p>  For this final project I decided to look at the locations of clinics
                 and hospitals alongside the life expectancy of each county. My initial
                 plan was to analyze how the location of healthcare facilities directly
                 intertwine with popoulation and illness. However, during the process of
                 searching for data I could not find clean sources. I was unable to clean up
                data sources to curate a story on that matter so I decided instead to look
                at how locations and the number of healthcare facilities availble in a region
                may affect overall healthcare by looking at life expectancy.

               Why is this important?
             </h6 >
               <p> The location and availability of healthcare location have been of utmost
                 importance espcially during these times of the COVID-19 pandemic. New stories
                 were actively sharing information about how hospital beds were filling in locations
                 leading to overflow at different locations. In articles from news sources such
                 such as  <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/03/18/974861952/lessons-from-the-covid-19-crisis-overcrowding-hospitals-cost-lives"> NPR </a> </li>
                 we can see how overcrowding and access to healthcare can have a direct impact on life and in life/death situations.
                 From this map we are able to view and ponder upon the relationship of access to health care, by viewing locations of places of healthcare, and life expectancy.

                Analysis
                </h6 >
                <p> The map is quite simple in nature. It displays three things. We can see clinic locations, hopsital locations, and life expectancy by county. Upon clicking on the icon of a hospital or clinic we can see the name and location of unit.
                  Upon clicking the blue spaces you are able to see the life expectancy and county. By looking at the overall trend of the map we cannot make any clear
                  conclusions but we can see some slight correlation between the number of healthcare facilites and life expectancy. That being with more helathcare locations the health expectancy may be higher. However this analysis is flawed since
                  the number of healthcare locations is not a favorable unit of meausre in itself. To have a better anlyasis the map should instead compare the availabilty and access to healthcare per person - hence
                  taking into account population of the counties.
