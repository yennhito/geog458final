# Life Expectancy by County v. Healthcare Locations

## Project Description
For this final project I decided to look at the locations of clinics
and hospitals alongside the life expectancy of each county. My initial
plan was to analyze how the location of healthcare facilities directly
intertwine with popoulation and illness. However, during the process of
searching for data I could not find clean sources. I was unable to clean up
data sources to curate a story on that matter so I decided instead to look
at how locations and the number of healthcare facilities availble in a region
may affect overall healthcare by looking at life expectancy.
